# qBittorrent MkII
My version of Home Assistant's built-in qBittorrent integration

Adds the following capabilites:
- An event is raised whenever a torrent is added, completed or removed (at the users' choice)
- A pause/resume option for a specific torrent, or for all torrents
- An additional sensor showing the overall percentage completion of all active torrents
